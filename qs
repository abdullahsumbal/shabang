Is the friends.py program a cgi program?jjj
	It is supposed to generate the webpage
	Does it matter how we generate the webpage
		print statements
		opening a file
	newfriends.py needs to update the friends.txt file right?
	
	so it goes make friends
		generates webpage
	on webpage new friends
		newfriends.py adds checked friends to friends.txt

Reformat users.txt
from 
USERNAME eander40
...

 to

eander40
pword
student

friends.txt has format like 
eander40 jzhu399 msumbal rprahd



cgi on the front end???
Can you explain cgi
	My current understanding is that it is a box or mechanism like http that transfers content from html forms to the server where the server starts a program that the form specifies.
	There is are a lot of details such as 
		the syntax of the cgi script url
		the print statement at the top of the cgi script
		is there anything else???


How do we make sure random people can't login to our website

Abdullah:
Can we have a cgi script that runs a bash script -> which runs another program. Can no #! at start of bash script
