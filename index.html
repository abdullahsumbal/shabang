			<h1>Welcome to #Shabang!</h1>
			<p> - a website for students before finals </p>
			<br>
			<p>
We started #! with the intention to create an environment for students to congregate. the #! refers to intense sentiments students feel in the final weeks of a semester. #! is specifically for all students to let out these intense sentiments in an open receiving space.
